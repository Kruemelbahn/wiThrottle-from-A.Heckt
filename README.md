# wiThrottle-from-A.Heckt
wiThrottle using JMRI-protocol.<br>
The base of implementation was done by A.Heckt: https://gitlab.com/fsmd/electronics/withrottle<br>
and published in "Digitale Modellbahn 03/2020".

For the next development steps on my side I copied the essential files.

Step 1 (v0.92, done): cleaning the code (free of warnings, using the latest libraries), creating first PCB<br>
Step 2 (v0.93, in progress): activating the OLED and allow users to enter a new locoaddress.<br>
